Got app working. Chose sockets over RESTful because events might come from the
machine and I don't want to be polling it on the time. 

Next steps:
> add GUI and hardare feedback when connection is there.
> GUI button creates single frame
    - call exec
    - check dir for photo
> show frame in GUI
> switch creates single frame
> GUi is updated with latest frame in dir
